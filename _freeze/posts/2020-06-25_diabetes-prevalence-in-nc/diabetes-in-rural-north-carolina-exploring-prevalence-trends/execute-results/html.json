In North Carolina alone, diabetes and prediabetes cost an estimated $10.9 billion each year  [@ADA2015]. This post introduces the exploration of the Diabetes epidemic in North Carolina. Through a series of posts this project will examine various public data available on diabetes and explore possible solutions to address the rise of diabetes in North Carolina. This investigation stems from the Capstone project of my Health Care Informatics Masters program.  This post will answer the following questions:\n\n\n> 1. What is the overall trend of diabetes prevalence in the United States?\n\n> 2. What is the trend of diabetes at a State Level and how does diabetes prevalence vary by state and region?\n\n> 3. How do trends in diabetes prevalence vary across counties of North Carolina? \n\n> 4. In which counties of North Carolina does the largest change in diabetes prevalence occur?\n\n> 5. How does change in diabetes prevalence compare between rural and urban counties?\n\n# Enviroment \n\n___This section contains technical information for deeper analysis and reproduction.

These numbers however, are estimates based on the self-reported response to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey, and do not represent the actual confirmed diagnoses. The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 adults have undiagnosed diabetes, therefore the numbers reported by the NHIS are likely to underestimate the true prevalence [@CDCP2020].\n\n# Overall - State Level\n\nState and County level data on diabetes prevalence are taken from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [(BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html). These results are based on the question \"Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you have diabetes?\".  Women who only experienced diabetes during pregnancy were excluded from the counts. The BRFSS is an ongoing, monthly telephone survey of the non-institutionalized adults (aged 18 years or older) in each state.  The year 2011 saw a major change to the methodology of the survey, which started to include homes without a landline phone.  This change was expected to increase coverage of lower income, lower educational levels, and younger age groups, because these groups often exclusively rely on cellular telephones for personal communication.[@Pierannunzi2012]\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns_g1 <- state_map %>% \n  st_drop_geometry() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, color = region)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = id ),alpha = 0.3,na.rm = TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  ggpmisc::stat_poly_eq(formula = y ~ + x ,\n                        aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = \"~~~\")), \n                        parse = TRUE) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2011, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette    = \"Dark2\"\n                     ,direction = -1\n                     ,labels    = snakecase::to_title_case\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Percentage of Diagnosed Diabetes in Adults (18+) \\nby State and Region\"\n    ,x       = NULL\n    ,y       = NULL\n    ,color   = \"Region\"\n    ,caption = \"Regions from US Census Bureau\"\n  ) \n\ns_g1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](diabetes-in-rural-north-carolina-exploring-prevalence-trends_files/figure-html/s-g1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above graph shows  diabetes prevalence trends by state, grouped into regions based on the US Census classification [regions](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).

We see that in 2016 there was a large spike in diagnosed cases; unfortunately this is the last available year so it is unclear whether the upward trend continues. The graph  below   compares state-level average  to the national average. Notice that the trend line is slightly higher than in the previous graphs: this is due to the age cut offs used for National and State level data vs County Level data. Previous data used 18 years of age as a cutoff for classifying adults, whereas the county level data uses 20. Due to removing 18- and 19-year-olds from the population, who typically have less diagnosed cases of diabetes than those of older ages, the computed prevalence increases slightly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd1 <- nc_diabetes_data %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarise(\n    pct = mean(percentage)\n    ,us_pct = mean(us_pct)\n  ) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols       = c(\"pct\", \"us_pct\")\n    ,names_to  = \"metric\"\n    ,values_to = \"values\"\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    metric = factor(metric\n                    ,levels = c(\"pct\",\"us_pct\")\n                    ,labels = c(\"NC\", \"National\"))\n  )\n\nnc_g1 <- d1 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = values, color = metric)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2011, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\")) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    x      = NULL\n    ,y     = NULL\n    ,color = NULL\n    ,title = \"Percent of Adults (20+) with Diagnosed Diabetes\"\n  )\n\nnc_g1 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](diabetes-in-rural-north-carolina-exploring-prevalence-trends_files/figure-html/nc-g1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see a spike in 2016, the last year for which the data are available.

For the purpose of this evaluation 2016 will be excluded from the county level data since the odd trend can not be explained and no further data is available to determine if this is a real spike or could be attributed to methodology change or data quality. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd2 <- nc_diabetes_data %>% \n  select(-us_pct) %>% \n  mutate(\n    pct_rural  = if_else(rural == TRUE, percentage, FALSE)\n    ,pct_urban = if_else(rural == FALSE, percentage, FALSE)\n  ) %>% \n  select(-countyfips,-percentage) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarise(\n    pct_rural = mean(pct_rural,na.rm = TRUE)\n    ,pct_urban = mean(pct_urban,na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>% left_join(us_diabetes_data) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols       = c(\"us_pct\", \"pct_rural\",\"pct_urban\")\n    ,names_to  = \"metric\"\n    ,values_to = \"value\"\n    ,values_drop_na = TRUE\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    metric = factor(metric,\n                    levels  = c(\"pct_rural\",\"pct_urban\",\"us_pct\")\n                    ,labels = c(\"Rural\",\"Urban\",\"US\")\n    )\n  )\n\nnc_g2 <- d2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = metric)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2011, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\")) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    x      = NULL\n    ,y     = NULL\n    ,color = NULL\n    ,title = \"Percent of Adults (20+) with Diagnosed Diabetes \\nDisplaying Rural vs Urban\"\n  )\n\nnc_g2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](diabetes-in-rural-north-carolina-exploring-prevalence-trends_files/figure-html/nc-g2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# By County - Geographical  \n\nCounty level data first became available in 2004, three years of data is used to arrive at these estimates.

This model-dependent approach employs a statistical model that \"borrows strength\" in making an estimate for one county from BRFSS data collected in other counties and states. Multilevel Binomial regression models with random effects of demographic variables (age 20-44, 45-64, >=65; race/ethnicity; sex) at the county-level were developed.

These graphs allow us to view geographical clusters of diabetes prevalence.   \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-body-outset}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnc_counties_map_binned <- nc_counties_map %>% \n  filter(year < 2015) %>% \n  mutate(\n    bin = dlookr::binning(.$percentage, nbins = 6 ,type = \"equal\")\n    ,bin = forcats::fct_recode(bin\n                               ,\"6.5   - 7.9\"  =  \"[6.5,7.97]\"\n                               ,\"8.0  - 9.4\" =  \"(7.97,9.43]\" \n                               ,\"9.5  - 10.9\" =  \"(9.43,10.9]\" \n                               ,\"11.0 - 12.4\" =  \"(10.9,12.4]\"\n                               ,\"12.5 - 13.8\" =  \"(12.4,13.8]\"  \n                               ,\"13.9 - 15.3\" =  \"(13.8,15.3]\"\n    )\n  )\n\nc_g1 <- nc_counties_map_binned %>% \n  filter(year %in% c(2006,2014)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf() + #blank geom_sf keeps gridlines from overlapping map\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = bin,color = rural)) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc_cities) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = nc_cities, \n                           aes(x = long, y = lat, label = city)\n                           ,nudge_y = c(-1,1,1,-1,1)\n                           ,nudge_x = c(0,0,0,-1,0)\n  ) +\n  geom_text(data = . %>% filter(rural == TRUE)\n            ,aes(x = center_long, y = center_lat)\n            ,label = \"R\"\n            ,color = \"#696969\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-84.5,-75.5), ylim = c(33.75,37)) +\n  facet_wrap(~year) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.6, direction = -1) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"FALSE\" = \"gray\"\n      ,\"TRUE\" = \"black\"\n    ),guide = 'none') +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Estimated Diabetes in Adults (20+) by County\"\n    ,fill = \"Percentage\"\n    ,y    = NULL\n    ,x    = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"aliceblue\")\n    ,panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"#D4D4D4\", linetype = \"dashed\", \n                                     size = 0.5)\n    ,legend.position = \"bottom\"\n    ,plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\nc_g1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](diabetes-in-rural-north-carolina-exploring-prevalence-trends_files/figure-html/c-g1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe following box plot displays the distribution of estimated cases by county from 2006 to 2014.

Through out this post it has been shown that this hypothesis is incorrect, just being a rural county does not indicate diabetes growth, in fact the growth rate throughout North Carolina has been consistent. Further posts will explore other reasons for these trends, as the  current post merely explores the trends and differences using data visualizations, a more rigorous and formal evaluation of these comparison is in order.  \n\n\n# Session information\n\n===========================================================================\n\nFor the sake of documentation and reproducibility, the current report was rendered in the following environment.
