    "text": "Todays post is a lesson in Facets, as well as humility. The task this week was to replicate the graph in Chapter 8 of Tableau for Healthcare in R. The graph in question is called a Table Lens (This is the name the book uses, however I did have trouble finding this name in Google searches), it is a collection of charts with a common theme, this time looking at countries in various WHO regions and some statistics associated with mortality as well as health expenditure. I say this is a lesson in humiltiy as I have read through the excellent book R for Data Science, and yet the idea of faceting a ggplot graph slipped my mind. This ended with hours of trying to find a package in R to line up graphs, and way more time then I care to admit spent on getting things prefect. I did find such a package called cowplots, which can be found here. While this is an excellent package, its use was unecessary and I reverted back to using the excellent facet feature of GGplot, which can be seen below! \n\nLoad Libraries\n\nlibrary(magrittr) #pipes\nlibrary(ggplot2) #ploting \nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\n\nImport Data\n\nds &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(path = \"../2020-01-04_my-start-to-r/Tableau 10 Training Practice Data.xlsx\"\n                        ,sheet = \"03 - WHO Life Expect & Mort\"\n                        )\n\n\n\nClean Names and Transform\n\nvarnames &lt;-  c(\"who_region\", \"country\", \"year\" , \"sex\" , \"life_expect_birth\" , \"neo_mort\"\n               ,\"under_five_mort\" , \"health_expenditure\")\nnames(ds) &lt;- varnames\n\n# Order Countries based on Life Expectancy at Birth\n\nds$country &lt;- factor(ds$country, levels = ds$country[order(ds$life_expect_birth)]) \n\n#To \"Long\" Form\n\nds1 &lt;-  ds %&gt;% pivot_longer(5:8)#select columns 5 throuh 8, leave new columns at default names\n\n# Set up labels for Facet, as well as function for Facet Labeller\n\nfacet_labels &lt;-  list(\n\"life_expect_birth\"   = \"Life Expectancy at Birth \"                            \n,\"neo_mort\"           = \"Neonatal Mortality Rate\"             \n,\"under_five_mort\"    = \"Under-Five Mortality Rate\"\n,\"health_expenditure\" = \"Health Expenditure per Capita (US$)\"  )\n\nvariable_labeller &lt;- function(variable,value){\n  return(facet_labels[value])\n}\n\n\n\nGraphs\n\nhightlight_countries &lt;- (c(\"Mauritania\", \"South Africa\")) \n\ng1 &lt;-  ds1 %&gt;% filter(who_region == \"Africa\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = c(\"life_expect_birth\" , \"neo_mort\"\n               ,\"under_five_mort\" , \"health_expenditure\"))\n         ,highlight = country %in% hightlight_countries) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = value, fill = highlight)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"World Bank Life Expectancy, Neonatal & Under-Five Mortality Rates, and Health Expenditure Analysis\"\n    ,x  = NULL\n    ,y = NULL\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(~name, scales = \"free_x\",labeller = variable_labeller) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(value, 0)), hjust = 0) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0,0.2))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"#fc8d59\", \"FALSE\" = \"#2b83ba\"))\ng1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{belanger2020,\n  author = {Belanger, Kyle},\n  title = {Facets and a {Lesson} in {Humility}},\n  date = {2020-01-29},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBelanger, Kyle. 2020. “Facets and a Lesson in Humility.”\nJanuary 29, 2020."

For this particular data set there are a couple things we need to add to replicate the example. In the original data set the date is stored with month, day, and year; the day is irrelevant and we need to pull out the month as well as the year. For this we can use the lubridate package, first we pull out the month and set it as a factor. For this example our year actually starts in October, so we set our factor to start at October (10), and end with September (9). We then pull out the year, which presents us with a different problem. Again our year starts in October, instead of January. To solve this I have created a variable called date adjustment, in this column is our month is 10 or greater, we will place a 1, if not a 0. We then set our fiscal year to be the actual year plus the date adjustment, this allows us to have our dates in the right fiscal year. Last the percent column is currently listed as a decimal, so we will convert this to a percentage.\n\n# split date time\nds1 &lt;- ds %&gt;% mutate(\n        #create month column, then set factors and labels to start fiscal year in Oct\n        month = month(ds$date)\n        ,month = factor(month\n                        ,levels = c(10:12, 1:9)\n                        ,labels = c(month.abb[10:12],month.abb[1:9]))\n       ,year = year(ds$date)\n        ,date_adjustment = ifelse(month(ds$date) &gt;= 10, 1,0 )\n        ,fiscal_year = factor(year + date_adjustment)\n        #convert % Pos from decmial to pct\n        ,pct_tests_pos_for_influenza = round(pct_tests_pos_for_influenza * 100, digits = 0)\n        )\n\nds1 %&gt;% glimpse()\n\nRows: 48\nColumns: 8\n$ date                                     &lt;dttm&gt; 2012-10-27, 2012-11-24, 2012…\n$ tests_pos_for_influenza_count            &lt;dbl&gt; 995, 3228, 22368, 24615, 1179…\n$ total_respiratory_specimens_tested_count &lt;dbl&gt; 18986, 24757, 66683, 75614, 5…\n$ pct_tests_pos_for_influenza              &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 13, 34, 33, 23, 17, 11, 6,…\n$ month                                    &lt;fct&gt; Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar,…\n$ year                                     &lt;dbl&gt; 2012, 2012, 2012, 2013, 2013,…\n$ date_adjustment                          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,…\n$ fiscal_year                              &lt;fct&gt; 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013,…"
